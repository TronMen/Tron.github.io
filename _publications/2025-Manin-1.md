collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publications/2025-Manin-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we study the Manin triples associated to n-Lie bialgebras. We introduce the concept of operad matrices for n-Lie bialgebras. In particular, by studying a special case
of operad matrices, it leads to the notion of local cocycle n-Lie bialgebras. Furthermore,
we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the double of n-Lie bialgebras and
Manin triples of n-Lie algebras.'
